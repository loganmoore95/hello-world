# hello-world
Getting started with GitHub repositories.

I love solving problems, and if I can do that using some R or Python, it's all the better.
Coding allows for all the stress v. reward tradeoff of video games, with exponentially more productivity.

# Working in Markdown
I have never worked in Markdown before, so this seems like a great place to get used to it's concepts.

You can make text **bold** or *italicized*.

>You can include text in blockquotes

You can have ordered lists
1. Make a list
2. Check it twice
3. Find out who's naughty or nice

And unorderd lists
- Eat
- Sleep
- Code
- Repeat

You can include code:

`fahrenheit_to_celsius <- function(temp_F){
temp_C <- (temp_F - 32) * 5 / 9
return(temp_C)
}`

And you can include a horizontal rule
